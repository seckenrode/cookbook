SCOTCH EGGS WITH HONEY-CHIPOTLE MAYONNAISE
==========================================

- 10 large eggs
- 2 lbs ground sausage meat
- 2 tablespoons fennel seed
- 2 tablespoons whole coriander
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon Kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 cup bread crumbs. seasoned with salt and pepper
- 1/4 cup parsley, ﬁnely chopped

Preheat deep-fat fryer to 375°F.

In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepot, place eggs in a single layer and cover with 1” of
lukewarm water. On high heat, bring to a boil, then remove from heat and cover for 10
minutes. Remove eggs from water and submerge in an ice bath until no longer warm.
Remove the shells and set eggs aside.

In a skillet over medium heat, toast the fennel seed and coriander for 2-3 minutes or until
highly fragrant. Allow to cool slightly, then grind. Thoroughly combine ground sausage
with spices, Dijon, salt and pepper. Cook a small patty in a skillet to check for seasoning
and adjust as necessary.

Combine bread crumbs and parsley in a bowl. Coat the outside of each egg with sausage
meat, roughly 1/4" in thickness. Roll each in ﬂour, shaking off the excess. Brush with
beaten egg, then coat with herb bread cmmbs, shaking off any excess.

Submerge in deep-fat fryer for 4-5 minutes or until brown and sausage is cooked through.
Remove, draining off excess fat, and serve warm with Honey Chipotle Mayonnaise.


Honey Chipotle Mayonnaise
=========================
      
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 teaspoon Dijon
- 1 1/2 cups canola oil
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 chipotle pepper, finely chopped
- Adobo sauce (from chipotle) and addltional Dijon, to taste
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yols with Dijon until pale yellow in color. Very slowly,
(especially at first), add oil while whisking constantly; if oil is added too quickly the
sauce will not emiilsify, so start slowly. Continue until all of the oil is incorporated. If
the sauce is too thick, add small amounts of water until the desired consistency is
achieved. Thoroughly incorporate honey and chipotle peppers, then season with salt and
pepper. Adobo sauce can be added to provide an earthy spiciness to this sauce, and
Dijon for tanginess. Serve with Scotch Eggs.


HONEY SPICED PORK ROAST WITH FENNEL AND FRUIT COMPOTE
======================================================

- 2 tablespoons juniper berries
- 2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
- 8 cardamom pods, crushed, pods discarded, black seeds reserved
- 1 tablespoon allspice berries
- 2 tablespoons fennel seeds

- 4 lb. pork loin, trimmed of fat
- 1/4 cup honey, wild flavor or Tupelo
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt

Preheat oven to 425°F.

 
Make the spice rub. In a small skillet, over medium high heat, toast the juniper berries, 
peppercorns, black cardamom seeds, allspice berries, and fennel seeds until fragrant (about
2-3 minutes). Let cool, add to a spice grinder and grind into a course powder. Add the salt
and blend well. Reserve 1 tbsp for the fennel and fruit compote.

Trim any excess fat from the pork loin and pat it dry. Pat the remaining spice mixture all
over the loin (you may not use it all). If desired, this can be done in advance and then
wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight -- if so, allow the meat to return
to room temperature before cooking.

Place the loin on a rack. Roast in the middle of the oven for 10 minutes, reduce the heat
to 350°F, and continue to roast the meat for an additional 20 minutes or until a thermometer
reads at least 110°F when inserted in the center of the roast. Remove the roast
from the over and carefully cover the top and sides with the honey, making sure not to damage
the crusted spice mlxture. Return the pork to the oven and continue to cook until an internal
temperature of 135°F is reached. Loosely tent the roast with foil, and allow it to rest 10
minutes before carving into 1/2 inch slices.

INDIAN SPICED ROASTED VEGETABLES WITH PANEER
==============================================

Homemade Paneer
---------------

Paneer is an Indian cheese that is quick, fast, easy, and delicious to make at home,

Place a colander in the sink and line it with 3 layers of dampened cheese cloth, leaving a
2 inch overhang. In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a boil, reduce the heat
immediately to low. Add the lemon juice and salt, stirring gently around sides; the mllk
will separate into fluffy curds and watery whey. Let the mixture sit for a few mmutes. If
the whey is still milky and opaque, add a bit more lemon juice. Pour the curds into the
cheesecloth-lined mold and allow to drain 10 minutes.

Gather up the corners of the cheesecloth and twist the cheese into a tight ball. Tie the
cheesecloth with string, then transfer it to a cutting board with the twisted, tied end off to
the side. Place a cutting board on the cheese, then a heavy skillet filled with tomato cans.
Let the cheese stand at least 10 minutes, preferably one hour, until dry and firm before
cutting into large cubes. The cheese may be wrapped in a clean damp towel and refrigerated
up to 24 hours.

For the roasted vegetables:

Combine the root vegetables (onion, potatoes, and carrots) in a large bowl. Pour some
marinade over them and toss until well coated. Check the vegetables for seasoning and
add more salt if necessary. Spread vegetables onto a full sheet pan in a single layer and
not crowded. Place in preheated oven. Combine the remaining vegetables and
marinade. Spread them onto a second full sheet pan in a single layer. After the root
vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, add the second sheet pan into the oven. Toss all
of the vegetables occasionally to roast evenly. When the vegetables are all tender, add
paneer to vegetables and roast for an additional 2 or 3 minutes. Place the vegetables on

- 1/4 cup white wine, if desired
- 1 cup chicken stock


Place oven rack on second level from bottom.
Pre-heat oven to 475°F.


Remove the fat from the tail, and discard the neck and giblets to make stock.
Reserve the liver for another use. Pat the chicken dry inside and out. Season the
cavity and skin with salt and pepper. Place the lemon half, garlic cloves and thyme
in the cavity.

Place the chicken in a shallow roasting pan just large enough to hold the chicken, breast-
side up and put it in the oven. After the first 10 minutes, move the chicken in the pan to
keep it from sticking. Roast for 20 to 30 more minutes, or until the juices run clear.
Internal temperature of the chicken should read 165 degrees, measured in the thickest part
of the thigh.

When chicken is done, carefully remove it to a cutting board -- as you lift the chicken, tilt
it over the roasting pan so that all the juices run out of the cavity and into the pan. Tent
the chicken with foil, and let rest while you make the sauce.

Pour off excess fat from the pan and put the pan on top of the stove. Add the white wine
and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom vigorously with a wooden spoon. When mostly evaporated,
add the stock and let reduce by half. Adjust the seasoning. Serve the sauce with the chicken.

CREPES SUZETTE
==============

For the Crepes
--------------

- 6 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 cup flour
- 3 tablespoons Cognac
- 1/4 cup sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1/4 cup clarified butter
- Additional clarified butter for crepe pan

In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients together. Strain into a bowl
and allow the mixture to rest for at least 30 minutes. Heat a crepe pan over medium-high
heat until droplets of water sizzle against the surface. Brush with melted clarified butter,
tilt the pan forward, and place approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons of batter in the lip of the
pan. Quickly tilt the pan from side to side so that the entire bottom of the pan is covered
with a thin layer of batter. Cook until browned and lacy and then carefully turn crepe
over with a spatula; brown the other side. Turn upside down, unmold onto a plate, and
continue with remaining batter.

For the Sauce
-------------

- 4 tablespoons Cognac, divided
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 4 tablespoons sugar, divided
- 1 1/4 cups freshly squeezed orange juice, divided
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 2 tablespoons Triple Sec or Grand Marnier

Heat a broiler-proof 12 inch skillet, add 3 tablespoons of Cognac and when vapors begin
to rise, tilt the pan to catch the flame and burn off the alcohol. Add the butter, 3
tablespoons of sugar, and 1 cup of orange juice to the skillet. Simmer over high heat,
whisking occasionally, until many large bubbles appear and mixture is reduced to a thick
syrup, about 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan and stir in remaining
1/4 cup orange juice, zest, liqueur, and remaining tablespoon Cognac. Set aside. Reserve
the unwashed skillet for later crepe assembly.

When ready to serve, rewarm the sauce in the saucepan. Preheat the broiler. Fold each
crepe in half and in half again to form a triangle; arrange around the reserved skillet,
pointing them in the same direction and overlapping slightly. Put a few in the center:
Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of sugar and broil until they warm and be it
caramelize, two to three minutes. Transfer crepes to individual serving dishes and sauce
each crepe with two or three tablespoons of sauce, leaving some areas unsauced.  The
crepes can be garnished with whipped cream or served with ice cream.
