Mudslide Cookies
================

*Drop cookie*

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
- 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate
- 1/2 cup cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon + 1/2 teaspoons reduction stout
- 4 large eggs
- 1 1/3 cups granulated white sugar
- 1 1/4 chopped walnuts (toasted)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.

Melt butter with both chocolates in a metal bowl over barely simmering water and reserve. (Double boiler)

In a small bowl. sift together cake flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.

In a separate small bowl. mix stout and vanilla and reserve.

Beat the eggs, sugar, and stout mixture with a whip attachment on high speed until light and thick. 6-8 minutes. Reduce speed; add chocolate mixture. Blend on medium speed until evenly mixed. 1-2 minutes. On low speed. add the dry ingredients until just blended. about 1 minute. Fold in nuts.

If necessary. refrigerate the dough until firm enough to hold its shape. 15-30 minutes. Using a 1/4-cup measure. scoop the dough onto the sheet pans. If desired, you can place the shaped cookie dough in the freezer to firm up. and then transfer it directly to the oven to ensure a fudgy interior.

Bake cookies until they are cracked on top but still appear moist. about 14 minutes. Be sure not to over bake. Cool slightly
