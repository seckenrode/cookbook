# Espresso Almond Cookie with Salted Caramel Frosting

Preheat oven to 350W and line sheet pans with parchment paper.

#### Cookies

- 4oz unsalted butter
- 3//4 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp Coffee Extract
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
- 1 T espresso powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 6 ounces Dark Lager
- 1/2 cup sliced natural almonds
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips

Beat butter and sugar with a mixer using the paddle attachment until light and fluffy. Add coffee extract and egg and beat to combine. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powders, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. With the mixer on low, add flour mixture in thirds, alternating with the Lager. Beat just until combined. Stir in chocolate chips and almonds. Scoop small mounds of cookie dough onto a parchment lined sheetpan, flattening slightly. Chill dough to help retain shape. Bake until dry at center. Cool completely.

#### Salted Caramel Frosting

- 4oz unsalted butter
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup powdered sugar

In a medium saucepan, melt butter, salt and brown sugar over medium heat, stirring to combine. Bring mixture to a boil, unstirred for 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately whisk in cream. (Carefull Hot caramel may spatter.) Cool slightly, then stir in powdered sugar. Stir briskly to smooth out any lumps. If needed, add powdered sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring briskly between each addition, until frosting is firm enough to hold a strong line.

Quickly frost the cooled cookies, as the frosting will begin to harden as it cools.
