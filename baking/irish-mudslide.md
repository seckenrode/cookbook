# Irish Mudslide

Preheat oven to 350oF and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.

- 2oz unsalted butter
- 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate
- 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate
- 1/2 cup cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon stout reductionf
- 4 large eggs
- 1 1/3 cups Stout Sugar
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (toasted)
- 1T Cocoa Nibs

In a small saucepan, reduce 4oz of Irish Dry Stout by half.  Cool completely.

Stir in 1 Tablespoon stout reduction into 1/13 cups of granulated sugar. Spread onto sheetpan and allow to dry. Add remaining stout reduction to butter/chocolate mixture.

Melt butter with both chocolates in a metal bowl over barely simmering water.

Beat the eggs and stout sugar with a whip attachment on high speed until light and thick, 6-8 minutes.

in a small bowl, sift together cake flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.

Reduce speed on mixer and add chocolate mixture. Blend on medium speed until evenly mixed.

On low speed, add the dry ingredients until just blended. Stir in nuts and nibs.

Using a small disher, scoop the dough onto the lined sheet pans. Place the shaped cookie dough in the freezer to firm up, and then transfer it directly to the oven to ensure a fudgy interior.

Bake cookies until they are cracked on top but still appear moist, about 14 minutes. Don't overbake!
