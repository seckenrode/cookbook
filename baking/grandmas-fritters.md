Grandma's Fritters
==================

- 2 cups self-rising flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 stp salt
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 tbsp melted butter
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup milk

Mix together, let rest for 30 minutes.

Heat Mazola corn oil until small amount of batter (dime size) when dropped into oil begins to sizzle.

Turn heat down to low/med and drop tbsp of batter 1 by 1 into hot oil. I do about 6 @ a time. They will turn themselves over (Most of the time they need help) to brown on other side.

When nice and crispy brown drain on paper toweling and shake powdered sugar on them and enjoy!!!!
