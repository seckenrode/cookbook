Molasses Crinkles
=================
*Shaped cookie*

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger (I use a full teaspoon)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup vegetable shortening at room temperature
- 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter. softened
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup grandmas molasses (NOT black strap or barbados!)
- Granulated sugar for sugaring tops of cookies

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Whisk together flour. baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, and salt in a bowl until combined.

Beat together shortening. butter. and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer (preferably fitted with paddle attachment) or 6 minutes with a handheld. Add egg and molasses, beating until combined.  Reduce speed to low.,and then mix in flour mixture until combined.

Mix together 2 parts sugar to 1 part cayenne in small bowl; set aside.

Roll 1 heaping teaspoon of dough into a 1-inch ball with wet hands, and then dip 1 end of ball in sugar cayenne mixture. Make more cookies in same manner, arranging them, sugared side up, 2 inches apart on 2 ungreased baking sheets.

Bake until undersides are golden brown. 10 to 12 minutes total, then cool on sheets 1 minute.

Transfer to racks to cool completely.
