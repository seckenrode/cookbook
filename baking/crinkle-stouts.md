# Crinkle Stouts

Preheat oven to 325F and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.

#### Stout Syrup
- 1 cup lrish Dry Stout
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar

Heat the beer and sugar in a non-stick skillet on low to medium heat until the mixture has boiled to a concentration of half the original volume. Set aside to cool.

#### Stout Sugar

- 1 and 1/2 cup white granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoon of the cooled stout syrup

Stir stout syrup into the granulated sugar. Spread onto sheetpan and allow to dry.

#### Crinkle Cookies

- 6oz unsalted butter
- 1 and 1/2 cup stout sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 4oz stout syrup
- 2 cups Flour
- 2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Beat the butter and stout sugar in an electric mixer with the paddle attachment until smooth.

Mix in eggs, one at a time until combined. Then mix in the stout syrup.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, spices and salt.

Reduce the speed of the mixer to low and slowly add the flour mixture. Once the cookie dough is just combined, remove from the mixture and transfer to a separate bowl.

Scoop out about a quarter-sized ball of dough. Allow to chill thoroughly in refrigerator.

Round each with your hand, then roll in the Stout sugar. Place at least 3 inches apart, these cookies will spread.

Bake until puffed and cracked. They may look slightly damp in center. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool.
