# Honey Ale Lemon Drops

Preheat oven to 325oF and line sheet pans with parchment paper.

#### Cookie

- 4oz unsalted butter, softened
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
- 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer with the paddle attachment until smooth. Add egg yolk and lemon extract. On low speed, add flour and salt, just until dough comes together.

Shape dough into 1 inch balls, placing each on the lined sheet pan. Make indentation in center of each cookie by pressing gently with the pad of your thumb.

Bake for until lightly golden. Remove from sheet pans and let cool.

#### Honey Ale Filling:

- 3 large eggs
- 3/4 cup granulated white sugar
- 4oz Honey Ale
- 2oz lemon juice
- 1T Cornstarch

Add Honey Ale and zest to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, combine eggs and sugar in a small bowl, whisking until pale. Add lemon juice/cornstarch. Temper hot ale into egg mixture and return to heat, stirring constantly until mixture begins to thicken. Mixture should maintain a boil for 1 minute. Strain into a clean bowl and chill over an ice bath.

When cookies are fully cooled, fill indentation with Honey Ale filling.
