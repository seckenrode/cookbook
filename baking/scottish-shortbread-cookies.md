Scottish Shortbread Cookies
===========================

*Shortbread*

- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup rice flour (can use cornstarch/corn flour)
- 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
- 1 /2 cup unsalted butter fFrozenl
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Have ready an 8 inch tart pan with a removable bottom.

In a large bowl whisk the flour with the rice flour (or corn flour/cornstarch) and the sugar.

Then take the very cold butter and grate it over the flour mixture with a box
grater.

With your fingertips work the butter into the flour by lifting small handfuls and rubbing the butter and flour together until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs (you do not want a dough to form).

Evenly press the shortbread into the tart pan. smoothing the top as best as you can. Prick the surface with the tines of a fork and then, with a sharp knife, score the top of the shortbread into 16 wedges. Chill in refrigerator for 10- 15 min.

Bake for about 40 - 50 minutes (watch carefully) or just until a light biscuit color. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes.

Then remove from tart pan. Place the shortbread round on a cutting board and cut each shortbread round into 16 wedges (along the lines scored). Cool
completely on a wire rack.
