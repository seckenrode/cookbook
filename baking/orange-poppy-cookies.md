# Orange Poppy Cookies

Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.

#### Honey Ale Reduction

- 1 cup Honey Ale
- 1 T honey

Heat the ale and honey in a small saucepan on low to medium heat until the mixture has boiled to a concentration of half the original volume.  Set aside to cool.  This will be used for both the cookie and the icing.

#### Cookies

- 6oz unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 tsp orange extract
- 3 oz Honey Ale Reduction
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tsp Salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 zest of an orange
- 2 tsp poppy seeds

Beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer with the paddle attachment until smooth. Add eggs, orange extract and Honey Ale Reduction. On low speed, add flour, salt, and baking soda. 

Add orange zest and poppy seeds and mix just until dough comes together.

Scoop small mounds of cookie dough onto a parchment lined sheetpan. Bake until light, golden brown and set. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely before icing.

#### Icing

- 1/2 tsp orange juice
- 2 T Honey Ale Syrup
- 1 orange zest
- 1 cup powdered sugar

Stir the orange juice, honey ale syrup and orange zest together. Stir this wet mixture into the powdered sugar until a smooth paste is achieved. Dollop onto the center of each cooled cookie and allow to spread. This icing may be stored in an air-tight container (place the wrap directly to the surface of the icing) if not being used immediately.
